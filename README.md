To implement Prolog programs:-

1. Install SWI-prolog;
2. Create a new folder anywhere you want, to write prolog programs;
3. Create file wth extension- .pl (i.e. hello.pl) or create file using SWI-Prolog (file->new->hello.pl);
4. Write code by using VSCode, Notepad or choose in SWI-Prolog (file->edit->choose file from the folder);
5. Then save the code;
6. To execute, go to SWI-Prolog;
7. File -> consult -> chose the file from floder or, you can do this by typing "cd('directory of the folder')." then press 'Enter' then type "[filename]." (i.e. if filename is hello.pl then type- [hello].);
8. Then write required queries to get result.
